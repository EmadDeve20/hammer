# Hammer

this is not my code actually I wanted to fix a bug in this script but it seems the real repository is dead. so I forked it for my own and I fixed it.

## Run

`python hammer.py -s [TARGRT_HOST] -p [TARGET_PORT]`

or

`python hammer.py -s [TARGRT_HOST] -p [TARGET_PORT] -t [COUNT_OF_PACKET_SEND]`
